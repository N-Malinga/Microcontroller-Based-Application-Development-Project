            <p>Non-communicable diseases are currently responsible for many deaths worldwide. About 70% of human deaths in Sri Lanka are caused by non-communicable diseases. Myocardial infarction, bronchial asthma, and hypertension are some major diseases among them. It's important to measure heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation level for the aforementioned disorders. Many patients visit the doctor merely to check the aforementioned vital signs or to show the report. </p>
